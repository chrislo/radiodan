* Player
  - explicitly set playlist when a new event is triggered, don't attempt to sync
  - #sync reads state_sync methods
    * #errors to determine which events to trigger
* MPD Adapter
  - Parse state into a player_state object, don't use openstruct anymore
    (User state_sync spec as guide)
  - Figure out a way of testing interface with playlist object
* StateSync
  - Attributes to sync:
    + Play mode
    + Contents of playlist
    + Position in playlist
    + Seek position for current item in playlist
  - Differentiate when a playlist 
    + is new (make this match exactly) 
    + is not (keep in bounds of acceptability)
* Player keeps useful information about current state.
  - PlayerState class
  - attributes:
    + play mode
    + play / stopped / paused
    + playlist
    + current / now playing
    + position in current track
    + metadata of current track
* Panic Mode
  - Add tests
