* Player
  - explicitly set playlist when a new event is triggered, don't attempt to sync
  - change #sync to use state_sync object
  - #sync reads state_sync methods
    * #sync? 
    * #errors to determine which events to trigger

* MPD Adapter
  - Parse state into a player_state object, don't use openstruct anymore
    (User state_sync spec as guide)
