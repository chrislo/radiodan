* Player
  - explicitly set playlist when a new event is triggered, don't attempt to sync
  - #sync reads playlist_sync methods
    + #errors to determine which events to trigger
    + Know when to restart playlists that repeat
    + Resume playlists from last position
* MPD Adapter
  - Figure out a way of testing interface with playlist object
* PlaylistSync
  - Attributes to sync:
    + Position in playlist
    + Seek position for current item in playlist
  - Differentiate when a playlist 
    + is new (make this match exactly) 
    + is not (keep in bounds of acceptability)
* Panic Mode
  - Add tests
